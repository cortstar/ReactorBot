# ReactorBot
Reacts to users with a message.

### Usage
1. Run config.py and follow the instructions. This wipes your previous config.
2. Run ReactorBot.py [app token]


### Problems
1. Right now HTTP errors aren't caught and cause ReactorBot to exit. This is to prevent app token banning from frequent reconnects. I recommend using your favourite process
scheduler to manage this problem away.
